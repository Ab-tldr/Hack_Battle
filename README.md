# Amber

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In emergency medical situations, timely access to medical care is crucial for saving lives. However, there is a pressing need for an efficient and technologically advanced ambulance network system that not only identifies the closest available ambulance but also offers immediate first aid guidance to bystanders and patients, enabling them to administer critical care measures and stabilize the patient's condition while awaiting the arrival of professional medical assistance.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION
We propose an integrated Ambulance Network and First Aid Guidance System to address the urgent need for efficient emergency response. Amber will feature real-time GPS tracking of ambulances and a comprehensive first aid database. Users can swiftly request an ambulance, view nearby options, and communicate with medical professionals. The system will employ an intelligent allocation algorithm to dispatch the nearest ambulance, factoring in traffic and emergency severity. Meanwhile, a user-friendly interface provides step-by-step first aid instructions for immediate care while awaiting professional help. Amber aims to save lives by bridging the gap between emergencies and professional medical assistance, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
